Hi!
I hope FutureAgeGameUI_Ferr will help Indie developers develop their games.

There are seven buttons, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple. There are 25 icons.
The icon colors are also in red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and purple.
You can use a combination of buttons and icons to suit your taste.

If you need more design, search ArtZombie in Asset Store.

For any questions please feel free to write me-- piaofengnv888@gmail.com
